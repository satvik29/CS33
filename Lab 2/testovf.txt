The first function returns 0 every single time, and is a pretty simple function without any checks. 
The second function, since we have compiled it using fwrapv defines what overflow is. It checks whether n + 9223372036854775807 is less than n. If it is less than n then it returns 1 and if it is greater than n it returns 0.
The third function, since we have not defined what overflow is and have used a higher level of optimization will include a check for overflow within the code. The code is longer because the compiler is instructed to include runtime checks to check whether the function has an overflow or not.

Hence the first function is very short because it is simple and has no checks. The second function is slightly longer because it has a defined overflow. The third function is much longer because it has some checks to make sure that the function hasn't overflowed because overflow is technically undefined behavior.
