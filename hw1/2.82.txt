A. False. (1 > INT_MIN) != (-1 > -INT_MIN)
B. True. The equation can be rearranged such that it gives you the same result on both sides.
C. True. This is because ~x = -1 - x.
D. False. Changing a signed integer to an unsigned integer will not change the bit pattern.
E. True. After analyzing both the positive and negative cases for x, realize that the final answer will always be the same.
F. True. After simplying -1 << we realize it's INT_MIN and analyzing the positive and negative cases we see that it will always give 1.
G. False. If x is -1 the right hand side is 127 but the left is -1.
